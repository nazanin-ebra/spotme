## The problem

Delivery and addresses aren't as simple in the MENA region as it is in the U.S, as here there is no postal addresses, and using location services just point to the street name.

My solution aims to combat this issue by providing an API endpoint that takes in any coordinates and with that delivers a way of navigating into the coordination are (Eg. Left from supermarket x, right at the end of the street...etc) which is what people here are used to.
Furthermore, it could make use of street view API to read the number of the building, giving a full, detailed address that is both easy to use, and scalable to countries without postal infrastructure such as Jordan.
